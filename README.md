# Slodowy transverse slices in Vinberg representations

This repository contains supplementary [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org) code for the paper "Families of curves in Vinberg representations" (insert ArXiv link) by Jef Laga and Beth Romano. It relies on the [SLA package](https://gap-packages.github.io/sla/) written and maintained by Willem de Graaf.

Open GAP and copy-paste or load the contents of "orbitsandweights.g". The file ?? contains various examples how to use these functions. The file ?? contains many stable gradings on exceptional Lie algebras.
