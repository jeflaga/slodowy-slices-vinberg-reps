# Slodowy transverse slices in Vinberg representations

This repository contains supplementary GAP code for the paper "Families of curves in Vinberg representations" (insert ArXiv link) by Jef Laga and Beth Romano. It heavily relies on the SLA package of Willem de Graaf (??)

Open GAP and copy-paste or load the contents of "orbitsandweights.g". The file ?? contains various examples how to use these functions. The file ?? contains many stable gradings on exceptional Lie algebras.
