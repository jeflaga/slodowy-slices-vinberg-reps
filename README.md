# Slodowy transverse slices in Vinberg representations

This repository contains supplementary [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org) code for the paper "Families of curves in Vinberg representations" (insert ArXiv link) by Jef Laga and Beth Romano. It relies on the [SLA package](https://gap-packages.github.io/sla/) written and maintained by Willem de Graaf.

The file "examples.g" contains various examples of the determination of all the nilpotent orbits of codimension at most 1 in a stable Vinberg representation, together with a determination of the weights of the $\mathbb{G}_m \times \mu_m$-action on the Slodowy slices $S_e$ for representatives $e$ of the nilpotent orbits.

The file "stablegradinglist.g" contains many stable gradings on exceptional Lie algebras.
